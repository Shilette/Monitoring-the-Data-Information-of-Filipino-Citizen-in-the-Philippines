# The Analysis of Poverty People in Region IV-A in Municipality of Batangas Area

**Introduction:**

       In Region IV-A Batangas Area poverty makes life difficult for every family member and for families as a whole in a society where injustice and discrimination are common and the screws of austerity and budget cuts continue to tighten. Poverty causes an imbalance in society's quality, resulting in ignorant individuals becoming homeless and unemployed, which leads to crime and revolution. People are usually involved in crime because they just cruise the streets looking for something worth to them in order to profit from it. Because they are destitute and unable to afford basic human requirements like as food, education, shelter, and health, today's youth are involved in criminal activities and commit numerous crimes. Nowadays, teenagers are unable to fill open jobs as applicants because they lack the basic skills required for formal employment due to a lack of work experience or training. Youth constitute the highest and fastest growing proportion of each society, therefore there is a need to understand the challenges they are facing. 
            
          Poverty is the lack of the basic needs of life, including food, shelter, clothing and safe drinking water. For a person to live normally, it is important to meet a certain level of physical, social, and emotional needs. People who live in poverty have difficult time to achieve those as they are not welcomed in many places. Because of their low incomes, they have troubles in maintaining their health, hunger, education. Poverty has become a large issue around the world. It is something that many of us know about but we’re not realizing just how big of a problem it is. This paper will include basic information about poverty, its effects, facts and statistics which can make people aware and want to help reduce poverty.

**Problem Statement:**

        Poverty occurs for many reasons, but in the Region IV-4 in Municipality of Batangas there are recurring factors that have slowed the development progress. 
      Economic growth is low compared to neighbouring countries. GDP growth is comparable, however, GDP per capita in relation to 
      the increase of population is much slower. Poverty directly impacts economic growth due to constraints in credit and the 
      underdevelopment of the financial market and inequality in income and assets. Another cause of poverty in the Region IV-A in Municipality of Batan is 
      the rise of unmanaged population growth. Because the poor tend to have bigger families, they are unable to access health 
      services or sex education, which leads to more children and the continuation of that cycle. The pattern of growth is common 
      in rural areas, but there has been a rise in poverty in urban areas. Municipality in Batangas have been faced with an increase
      in poverty due to lack of well-paid employment. One of the main causes of poverty in the Philippines especialy in the Region IV-A in Municipality of batangas is the vulnerability to natural disasters. Natural disasters in the Philippines have caused US$23 billion in damages since 1990, which continues to 
      delay the development process. 

**Significance of the Proposed Project:**
      
         This research will provide the data information of every Filipino Citizen in the Philippines. The research will specially 
      benefit the following:
      
      • Government - the most likely to benefit from our research. Because they'll know how much poverty there is in the 
      Philippines, which will help them with their poverty research. It is easier for the government to assist disadvantaged 
      individuals. It will be simpler for them to create different companies for different locations so that they can readily feed
      the underprivileged. They will go for it, especially with thin youngsters, and will provide free check-ups and medicine. So
      that they will be healthy and malnourished youngsters will not enter our population. Poverty means that the income level from 
      employment is so low that basic human needs can't be met. Poverty-stricken people and families might go without proper housing, 
      clean water, healthy food, and medical attention. Each nation may have its own criteria for determining how many of its people 
      are living in poverty.

      • Community – donate money and time, and look for volunteer opportunities One of the most simple ways to assist your community 
      battle poverty is to donate money to organizations whose aim is to eliminate economic inequality. There is no such thing as a 
      tiny or huge sum of money. As the money accumulate, groups can use them to address housing inequities, education gaps, food 
      insecurity, and other issues. Another useful alternative is to join forces with local organizations that aid the community by 
      contributing their time. There are methods to have an effect that don't require money, whether it's volunteering in a food 
      pantry or working with children after school to help them finish their homework. To help us continue our work, we've created a 
      volunteer waitlist that you can join.

      • Citizen –  the benefits here will be able to achieve our dream of being able to study and then value education as a student 
      who has a beak, can work well, no one will go hungry, and it will be difficult to work hard, we will rise in life, and we will
      not be able to increase the population of poor people to eat three times a day all the poor, and we will assist with the 
      activities that will take place in our area to also help stop poverty in the Philippines.


      • Future Researchers - this paper will review a wide range of this research and discuss the underlying perspectives that 
      characterize entrepreneurship and poverty alleviation. We will, in turn, use these perspectives to lay out an agenda for 
      future research.

**Methods:**

      	  The analysis uses a comprehensive framework for assessing poverty in the Region IV-A in Municipality of Batangas. It examines the key areas that are relevant 
      to poverty reduction: increasing incomes, human capital, and capacity; risk protection; and voice and empowerment in governance 
      and institutions. It uses quantitative (trends in poverty and related indicators data, regression analysis for poverty 
      correlates) and qualitative analysis (key informant interviews) to assess the poverty situation as it relates to the overall 
      development of the Municipality of Batangas. A workshop was organized to discuss the findings of the study, to get feedback from key stakeholders,
      and to identify concrete and actionable recommendations. An institutional mapping analysis was also undertaken to assess the 
      current responses to the state of poverty in the Region IV-A in Municipality of Batangas.

**Expected Output:**
        
        This analysis aims to track and collect data on every Filipino citizen in the Region IV-A Municipality of Batangas in order to identify the need to focus more and pay attention in order to permanently reduce the number of poor people in the Philippines. Additionally, The First Semester 2021 poverty incidence among population, or the proportion of poor Filipinos whose per capita income is not sufficient to meet their basic food and non-food needs, was estimated at 23.7 percent. This translates to 26.14 million Filipinos who lived below the poverty threshold estimated at Php12, 082, on the average, for a family of five per month in the first semester of 2021. On the other hand, subsistence incidence among Filipinos, or the proportion of Filipinos whose income is not enough to meet even the basic food needs, was registered at 9.9 percent or about 10.94 million Filipinos in the first semester of 2021. On the average, the monthly food threshold for a family of five for the same period was estimated at Php8, 393. (Figure 1, and Tables 2 and 4). Among families, the First Semester 2021 poverty incidence was estimated at 18.0 percent, which is equivalent to around 4.74 million poor families. Meanwhile, the subsistence incidence among families was recorded at 7.1 percent, or around 1.87 million food poor families in the first semester of 2021. 
        This analysis will be updated on a regular basis to see if there has been a significant shift in the impact of this research on each other and, in particular, on the government that oversees it.


**Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) of the Project:**
	
          These SDGs are further described as follows;

      Goal 1: No Poverty - This goal strives to end poverty in all area of Batangas. These SDG will create sound policy frameworks at the Municipality of Batangas, 	based on estimating poor by year of 2000, 2003, 20006, 2009, 2012, 2015, 2018 to know the poorest in Batangas area to support accelerated investment in poverty 	eradication actions.
