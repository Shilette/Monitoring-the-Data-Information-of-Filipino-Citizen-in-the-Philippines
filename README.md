# The Analysis of Poverty People in Region IV-A in Municipality of Batangas

**Introduction:**

         In Region IV-A Batangas Area poverty makes life difficult for every family member and for families as a whole in a society where injustice and discrimination are common and the screws of austerity and budget cuts continue to tighten. Poverty causes an imbalance in society's quality, resulting in ignorant individuals becoming homeless and unemployed, which leads to crime and revolution. People frequently get involved in crime because they are simply looking for something valuable to earn from on the streets. Because they are destitute and unable to afford basic human requirements like as food, education, shelter, and health, today's youth are involved in criminal activities and commit numerous crimes. Nowadays, teenagers are unable to fill open jobs as applicants because they lack the basic skills required for formal employment due to a lack of work experience or training. Because youth make up the largest and fastest-growing segment of any society, it is critical to comprehend the issues they face.
            
         Poverty is characterized as a lack of basic necessities such food, shelter, clothing, and clean water. It is necessary to meet specific bodily, social, and emotional demands in order to live normally. Poverty-stricken people have a tough time achieving these goals because they are not welcome in many places. They struggle to keep their health, food, and education due to their low salaries. Poverty has become a global problem and many of us are aware of it, but we are unaware of the magnitude of the situation. This article will provide fundamental knowledge about poverty, its affects, facts, and figures that will help individuals become more aware of poverty and wish to help.

**Problem Statement:**

       Poverty can be caused by a variety of sources, but in the Municipality of Batangas' Region IV-4, there are several problems that have hindered development. Compared to neighboring countries, economic growth is slow. Although GDP growth is comparable, GDP per capita growth is substantially slower when compared to population growth. Due to credit limits, underdevelopment of the financial market, and income and asset disparity, poverty has a direct impact on economic growth. Unmanaged population expansion is another source of poverty in Batangas Municipality's Region IV-A. Because the impoverished tend to have larger families, they are unable to get health care or sex education, resulting in more children and the cycle continuing.

**Significance of the Proposed Project:**
      
         This research will provide the the Analysis of Poverty People in Region IV-A in Municipality of Batangas. The research will specially benefit the following: 
	 
	 • Government - the most likely to benefit from our research. Because they'll know how much poverty there is in the Philippines, which will help them with their poverty research.It is easier for the government to help the poor. It will be simpler for them to create different companies for different locations so that they can readily feed the underprivileged. They will go for it, especially with thin youngsters, and will provide free check-ups and medicine. So that they will be healthy and malnourished youngsters will not enter our population. Poverty is defined as a level of income from work that is insufficient to meet fundamental human needs. Poverty-stricken individuals and families may lack enough housing, clean water, nutritious food, and medical care. Each country may have its own set of criteria for calculating how many people live in poverty.

      • Community – donate money and time, and look for volunteer opportunities One of the most simple ways to assist your community battle poverty is to donate money to organizations whose aim is to eliminate economic inequality. A small or large sum of money does not exist. As the money accumulate, groups can use them to address housing inequities, education gaps, food insecurity, and other issues. Another useful alternative is to join forces with local organizations that aid the community by contributing their time. There are methods to have an effect that don't require money, whether it's volunteering in a food pantry or working with children after school to help them finish their homework. We've established a volunteer waitlist, which you can join to assist us continue our work.
      
      • Citizen –  the benefits here will be able to achieve our dream of being able to study and then value education as a student who has a beak, can work well, no one will go hungry, and it will be difficult to work hard, we will rise in life, and we will not be able to increase the population of poor people to eat three times a day all the poor, and we will assist with the activities that will take place in our area to also help stop poverty in the Philippines.


      • Future Researchers - this paper will review a wide range of this research and discuss the underlying perspectives that characterize entrepreneurship and poverty alleviation. We'll then use these viewpoints to develop a research agenda for the future.
      
**Methodology:**

      	  The analysis uses a comprehensive framework for assessing poverty in the Region IV-A in Municipality of Batangas. It examines the key areas that are relevant 
      to poverty reduction: increasing incomes, human capital, and capacity; risk protection; and voice and empowerment in governance 
      and institutions. It uses quantitative (trends in poverty and related indicators data, regression analysis for poverty 
      correlates) and qualitative analysis (key informant interviews) to assess the poverty situation as it relates to the overall 
      development of the Municipality of Batangas. A workshop was organized to discuss the findings of the study, to get feedback from key stakeholders,
      and to identify concrete and actionable recommendations. An institutional mapping analysis was also undertaken to assess the 
      current responses to the state of poverty in the Region IV-A in Municipality of Batangas.

**Expected Output:**
        
     This analysis aims to track and collect data on every Filipino citizen in the Region IV-A Municipality of Batangas in order to identify the need to focus more and pay attention in order to permanently reduce the number of poor people in the Philippines. Additionally, The First Semester 2021 poverty incidence among population, or the proportion of poor Filipinos whose per capita income is not sufficient to meet their basic food and non-food needs, was estimated at 23.7 percent. This translates to 26.14 million Filipinos who lived below the poverty threshold estimated at Php12, 082, on the average, for a family of five per month in the first semester of 2021. On the other hand, subsistence incidence among Filipinos, or the proportion of Filipinos whose income is not enough to meet even the basic food needs, was registered at 9.9 percent or about 10.94 million Filipinos in the first semester of 2021. On the average, the monthly food threshold for a family of five for the same period was estimated at Php8, 393. (Figure 1, and Tables 2 and 4). Among families, the First Semester 2021 poverty incidence was estimated at 18.0 percent, which is equivalent to around 4.74 million poor families. Meanwhile, the subsistence incidence among families was recorded at 7.1 percent, or around 1.87 million food poor families in the first semester of 2021. 
    This analysis will be updated on a regular basis to see if there has been a significant shift in the impact of this research on each other and, in particular, on the government that oversees it.


**Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) of the Project:**
	
          These SDGs are further described as follows;

      Goal 1: No Poverty - This goal strives to end poverty in all area of Batangas. These SDG will create sound policy frameworks at the Municipality of Batangas, 	based on estimating poor by year of 20006, 2009, 2012.
